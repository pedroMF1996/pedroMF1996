### Hello, I'm Pedro Falleiros.
I'm a Systems Developer Analyst, currently working with Angular and .Net Core allocated in a stockbroker company.

#### About me
Greetings,

Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Pedro, and I come from Ribeirão Preto, São Paulo. I am a software developer with four years of education in the field and three years of professional experience. My passion for technology began when I enrolled in the ADS (Analysis and Systems Development) course at university, where I created my first program using the programming language C - a hash game (tic-tac-toe) that introduced me to the world of programming and software development. Ever since, I have been driven by a thirst for knowledge, seeking extracurricular courses in areas such as Object-Oriented Development, Test-Driven Development, and Artificial Intelligence.

My most recent work experience was at a financial cooperative, where I was involved in software development for their operations. In this role, I used Angular, Angular Material, SCSS, and Tailwind for front-end development, and C#, ASP.NET Core, DDD, and CQRS for the back-end. I also gained experience in unit testing and automated testing. Prior to that, I worked at a software development company where I contributed to various projects for clients in different industries. One of these clients was a brokerage firm, where I worked on a trading platform. This project involved the use of technologies such as C#, .NET Core, Entity Framework Core, DDD, and TDD. I also gained experience in front-end technologies such as Angular, SCSS, and Bootstrap.

My areas of interest in software development include Object-Oriented Development, Test-Driven Development, Reactive Programming, and Event-Driven Architecture. I have experience with a variety of technologies, including programming languages such as C# (Framework/Core), JavaScript, and TypeScript. Additionally, I am familiar with testing frameworks like xUnit and Jasmine. Furthermore, I have worked with databases such as Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, and MSSQL, and I am proficient in creating UML diagrams using yEd.

I am enthusiastic about expanding my knowledge and expertise in the field of software development and look forward to contributing to exciting projects in the future.

Best regards,

Pedro
